# Tempest
This weather dashboard is a simple webpage to access a [Tempest weather station](https://shop.tempest.earth/). The default app for Tempest is already fantastic, but this webpage is designed to make it easy to gauge windspeed for a local air strip for paramotor launches by making the direction of wind obvious and the history of wind easily readable. To make this app work for you, install all required python libraries and then adjust the config.json to tailor the webpage for your location and tempest api credentials.
